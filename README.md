# chimayo

Chimayo is a library for creating and manipulating SQL Server Integration Services packages with F# code.

Chimayo provides a completely different development experience for producing SSIS packages that fits
with modern software development:

* Write code, not a custom DSL, and benefit from refactoring, compile-time testing, test automation and reuse
* Generate SSIS packages that work well in version control systems, such as Git, or just keep the F#
  code and generate them on demand
* Benefit from functional programming with pattern matching, immutable data structures and strong typing

Chimayo is not object-oriented software and is designed to be consumed directly from F#.

Chimayo also provides a command line tool that can be used to convert between supported SSIS formats.

# Getting started

NuGet packages are coming. For the moment, you need to download and compile the source.

I am currently in the process of setting up the project for community involvement. Please be patient.
